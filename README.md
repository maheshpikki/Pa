# Project Title
This Project Title is Plant Disease Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks.

# Project Description
• Early detection of crop diseases is crucial for minimizing crop loss in India, significantly impacting food security and the economy.
• We have implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. CNNs are widely used for image-related tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical patterns and features from images.

# Technologies Used
We had used python, Machine Learning algorithm and we used streamlit for our frontend.

# Libraries Used
 TensorFlow,
 Matplotlib,
 Pandas,
 Seaborn,
 OpenCV.
